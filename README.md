# Old-Projects
------------------------------------
This is just for my old projects that I don't plan on working on anymore
I will try to upload a basic description of each one as I go. 
------------------------------------


ComputerScienceProject (JavaScript/HTML/CSS)
------------------------------------
This is just a project I did for AP computer science years ago. 
It has a couple versions of tetris, snake, minesweeper, a clicker, 2048, dino game, sudoku, etc. Of course only like two of those projects actually will run.

PyGame (Python)
------------------------------------
Contained in this zip is like 4-5 differant versions of the same game I was working on making. It was a text based adventure game.
I like it's idea however it needs graphics and never worked very well, I plan on remaking it someday. Possibly in C# or some other language.

ALL THE VIRUS/BAT STUFF (Batch)
------------------------------------
I don't remmeber what all of these files do, they should all be viruses of some kind. I know that there is a lot to take up memory and alot to file folder bomb
they will cuase problems and are not fun if you run them so I would not recomend it
You can give them to other people and run it on their computer for some harmless fun though
